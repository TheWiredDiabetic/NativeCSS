# About this subfolder
This subfolder houses all the NativeCSS website elements, such as logos, javascript files, CSS stylesheets and other files. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads up!
This is **NOT** the **PUBLIC RELEASES FOLDER**, meaning this folder will not display the newly released CSS files or JS files, I'd recommend navigating back to the root of the repository and locate the public releases folder,
as there will house the more lively updated files, this is for the NativeCSS website only, again **FOR THE WEBSITE ONLY.**

## üîî If you choose to use anything from here.
Ensure you are inline with the license, and credit us for our work :)
