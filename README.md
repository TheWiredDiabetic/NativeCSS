## What does NativeCSS do?
> **NativeCSS** provides website builders with ease when building their websites, similar to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
> and many more CSS based agents, which you can find on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) if you need other cool addons for your website.

## How does NativeCSS work?
> Native works by importing it by one simple line of import code, and works in simple lines of code. When using NativeCSS's styles, it'll use the attribute commonly known as **'class'** (not to be mistaken by id, which defines a element if using it in JavaScript code). For example, it'll be something like this.
>
> ```html
>  <div class="element1 element2 element3>
> ```
>
> In class attributes, you can define more than just one item, meaning you can apply more than one piece of CSS style code to your element. Where it brings NativeCSS into play, as it's packed with many of CSS elements you can use in development.

## How do I get NativeCSS?
### 1. Import via URL
> You can import the latest release via the line of code below, however, you need to form your document as such, the line of code will only work if it's place in the head tag.
<details>
<summary>Template Code</summary>
```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
          <title>Example Code</title>
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
          <!-- You'll place any import or scripts here. -->
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello World.</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
```
</details>

### 2. Download and self-host
> You can download the code and upload it your projects repository or server to use in your own project.
> ```html
> <link rel="stylesheet" href="\css\mycssfile.css">
> ```

  
> You'll place this code in your head tag for it to automatically import it on page load.
> ```html
> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://nativecss.vercel.app/">
> <!-- The code above will change when a confirmed release occurs. -->
> ```
